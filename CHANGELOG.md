## 0.6.5 - 2019-04-23

* Use ExDoc 0.20.2

## 0.6.4 - 2019-04-10

* Use new ExDoc 0.20.1

## 0.6.3 - 2019-04-03

* Use new ExDoc 0.20.0

## 0.6.2 - 2018-07-30

* Fixed warnings new to Elixir 1.7

## 0.6.1 - 2018-04-24

* Fixed race condition if two processes try to start the same channel at the same time by calling subscribe.

## 0.6.0 - 2018-04-24

* Now has no external dependencies. Removed Phoenix PubSub in favor of in-process state in `Channel`.

This is a somewhat backwards incompatible update:

* Since Phoenix PubSub is no longer used, it is no longer using CRDTs to sync state between nodes. However, Hub was
really not compatible with multiple nodes before anyway.
* The return type of `Hub.subscribe/3` and `Hub.subscribe_quoted/3` is now
`Channel.subscription_ref :: {pid, reference}` instead of `reference`. This is now also the type that `Hub.unsubscribe`
accepts. If the calling code don't require the return value to be a `reference` it will continue to work as before.

## 0.5.0 - 2018-04-20

* Runs every channel in its own process to avoid race condition

## 0.4.1 - 2018-02-05

* Moved organization on Github, https://github.com/vesta-merkur/hub -> https://github.com/wise-home/hub


## 0.4.0 - 2017-12-18

* Can unsubscribe ([#8](https://github.com/wise-home/hub/pull/8))

Breaking changes:

* Hub.subscribe/3 and Hub.subscribe_quoted/3 now returns {:ok, reference} instead of :ok
* Attempting to subscribe with the same pattern again from the same pid on the same channel will now make two
  subscriptions. Before, the old one would be updated.

## 0.3.0 - 2017-11-22

* Can subscribe to multiple patterns in one subscription ([#6](https://github.com/wise-home/hub/pull/6))

## 0.2.1 - 2017-04-18

* Fix edge case pins

## 0.2.0 - 2017-04-18

* Allow local variables to be pinned in pattern ([#3](https://github.com/wise-home/hub/pull/3))

## 0.1.0 - 2017-04-14
